This repository contains a **real-world React example** to understand how  
the **useReducer hook** works in a clean and structured way.

## 🔹 What is this project?

This is a **Bank Account simulation app** built using React where:

- One state (balance)
- Multiple actions (Deposit, Withdraw, Reset)
- Logic is handled using **useReducer**

useReducer should be used instead of useState.
